                    I'm a FSWD graduated from Ac√°mica. I'm currently working at Sentate as a Full Stack Web
                    Developer as well as I'm part-time freelancer. 
                    <br/>
                    I have 6 months of experience working with Sentate on a booking management platform project.
                    The most relevant technologies are:
                    React-redux, JavaScript, MongoDB, CSS/Sass-SassCript (BEM - methodology), HTML5, GIT. Libraries/Modules like Express, Axios,
                    bcrypt, JWT, just to name a few.
                    <br/>
                    I like to create the best web experience, that includes efficiency on the back as well as awsome interactions on the front. This portfolio has been made based on that, i hope you like it.
